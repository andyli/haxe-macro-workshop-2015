# haxe-macro-workshop-2015

Gateway drugs for the world of Haxe macros.

## Welcome

This repository contains a set of example projects for the macro introduction workshop at WWX 2015.

We'll walk through some of the concepts, then look at some of the example problems.
Some of the examples have worked solutions already.
The rest of them we will work through as a group - and add them to the repository later.

## Play Areas

* [Interpreter](interpreter)

## Problems

* [Include release notes in your build](include_release_notes)
* [Quick object initialisation](object_initialisation)
* [Short lambdas](short_lambdas)
* [Macro powered CLI tools](automatic_cli_tools)
